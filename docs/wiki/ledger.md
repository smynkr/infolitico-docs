# Durable ledger

## 2026-08-10 — Standalone Infolitico docs site established

- Scoped from the axiom-docs Fumadocs stack as a single-product site:
  canonical flat MDX under `infolitico/`, generated `content/docs/`, contract
  tests, related-guide wayfinding, and the docs-agent pipeline. All Axiom
  product content, hub components, changelog, Notion mirror, and weekly-recap
  machinery were removed.
- Brand: Infolitico accent `#5E0F1C` (from the live landing capture), custom
  flame mark (`public/logo.svg`), favicon tile
  (`public/favicon.svg`); no Axiom identity anywhere in the chrome.
- Clean URLs: `/` and `/getting-started` … `/faq` rewrite onto the
  `infolitico/*` canonical routes (`next.config.mjs`).
- DNS `docs.infolitico.com` already pointed at Vercel anycast
  (76.76.21.21); domain attached to the Vercel project during launch.
- Automation: `pipeline/docs-agent.yml` template adapted for
  `smynkr/infolitico-docs`; the `infolitico` repo receives the workflow with
  `DOCS_AGENT_PRODUCT: infolitico`.

Re-establish with:

```bash
node _migration/tools/run-migration.mjs
npm run test:links
npm run links:check
npm run types:check
npm run build
npm run memory:check
```
